      I am a backend software engineer with some abilities in front end. I do
      prefer do do not state myself as a fullstack, but I like to do some works
      with React or Vue in front end.


      My main abilities are focused in backend, so I really love to work with
      node.js and I worked for a long time with PHP.


      I have some experience with other backend tech stacks, such Java and .NET.
      But to be very honest I do prefer to work with node and I have a huge
      interest in learn more about Golang.


      Take a look in the skills section to learn more about what I can do.


      You can check out my portfolio page to take a look in the projects I\`ve
      done in these years as a software engineer.


      Also, if you are interested you can read about my personal history until
      I\`m reach my actual tech skills, just because I think that my history is
      about overcoming in personal and professional life.
