      ### A short brief story about my skills


      Basically, my skills are focused in the following areas of interests:


      *   Backend technologies (my main focus)

      *   Database - SQL or noSQL (my second main focus)

      *   Front end (not really a fullstack, but I can make some interesting
      things)

      *   Cloud (I really don’t want to work as a specialist in this area, but I
      like to use some things for my own benefit)

      *   Linux Servers (not a specialist , but in these years I have spawned
      some servers for my apps)

      ## My actual backend stack


      I have to say, I really love the simplicity of node. I know that node is
      not the best bet for heavy processing tasks which I need a lot of threads,
      but for web based applications or even workers for parsing something to
      deliver transformations or even content to be digested in other
      applications, I think node is very suitable.


      Currently I\`m not used to apply Typescript, but I have no problem working
      with a typed project, because I know how to work with this kind of
      approach thanks my Java background.


      The kind of projects I worked with node?


      *   Backend apis as microservices


      *   Web scrappers (for apps which doesn’t had any api or even to get some
      data from websites)


      *   Workers to parse some data to deliver for partners (heavy use of
      streams with back pressure control)


      *   ETL applications for people which doesn’t want to use proper ETL
      solutions in edge cases


      *   Fullstack applications (some freelancer jobs)


      A important thing to be mentioned here is, I use node with SQL and noSQL
      databases. Also, I like to use redis as a cache for my apps. I know some
      good patterns such circuit breakers and other cool things, like functions
      and jobs pipelines.

      ## A later love, never forget


      PHP was my main stack for at least 5 years. I really love the simplicity
      of PHP.


      I used to use PHP with Mysql or Postgresql. But I have some projects with
      SQL server and Oracle databases too.


      PHP was my first choice for my freelancer jobs, fullstack applications,
      apis and little integrations in my portfolio have PHP as tech stack.


      My main achievement with PHP is an ERP. Believe me, this project was big.
      Check out my portfolio section to see more details about this challenging
      project.
