      ### A short brief story about my skills


      Basically, my skills are focused in the following areas of interests:


      *   Backend technologies (my main focus)

      *   Database - SQL or noSQL (my second main focus)

      *   Front end (not really a fullstack, but I can make some interesting
      things)

      *   Cloud (I really donâ€™t want to work as a specialist in this area, but I
      like to use some things for my own benefit)

      *   Linux Servers (not a specialist , but in these years I have spawned
      some servers for my apps)
